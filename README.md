Python email creator is the beta creator of email templates. It helps to create email and convert it to HTML format so you can skip the HTML editing every time.

This beta project was created as an email creator for my company, I've changed colors and images to some generic Python schemes for rights protection.
You can also change HTML content here for your specific schemes, so the creator will be suited for your email.

quick guide:

In "Table Name" you enter table type (table_1, table_2, teble_3, table_4) and your text to "Text:" field, after it is ready click "Generate HTML" to create a label - repeat that to each label separately.
for label and finish you don't need to put anything in "Text:" field, it will do no changes. "label" creates ending label with company info
"finish" will trigger email template creation and only then your email template file will be created in "output folder" (raw HTML in the creator itself will be created in the real-time).
table 5 - here also do not put anything in "Text:" field this will trigger prompt for column 1 (subject) with text input and then for column 2 (content)
